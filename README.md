# Snake Running NEAT Algorithm

<b>N</b>euro<b>E</b>volution of <b>A</b>ugmenting <b>T</b>opologies (NEAT), is a form of artificial intelligence that I chose for this particular project mostly due to the inspiration from a far more <a href="https://github.com/Code-Bullet/SnakeFusion">extensive project</a> done in Processing though this developer being one of the main inspirations into machine learning.

While the AI will play the game it will reach a point of mastery that will not end in a true win for the game. I feel it may be a limitation of myself as a coder or the simplicity in the implementation. Another option would be to pursue the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path">Hamilton cycle</a> but I feel that would be less about learning to play the game rather than just solving the game perfectly.
