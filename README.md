# Snake Running NEAT Algorithm

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is an experiment using neural networks with genetic algorithms to play a game of snake. With the goal was to make the entire project as minimal as possible when it came to use of libraries. There is still more work to be done in optimisation of the AI's neural networks.
